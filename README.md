# Job Search and Posting Website

This project is a comprehensive **Job Search and Posting Platform** built with **Flask**. The platform allows users to search for jobs, post job listings, and classify job postings into four distinct categories using machine learning models.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔎 Job Search and Posting  
- Users can search for jobs using advanced filters and keyword-based search.  
- Employers can post new job listings, which are automatically classified into relevant categories.  
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.

### 🧠 Machine Learning-based Job Classification  
- Built a robust job classification system using three text embedding techniques:  
   - **Count Vectorizer** – Achieved **65% accuracy**  
   - **TF-IDF** – Achieved **89% accuracy**  
   - **Word2Vec** – Achieved **82% accuracy**  
- A logistic regression model was used to train and classify job listings.  
- Conducted extensive comparative analysis to determine the best-performing embedding method (TF-IDF outperformed others by 24% over Count Vectorizer and 7% over Word2Vec).

  * Note the data and the word embedding models can be obtained on request as its locally trained and the data is confidentail.
